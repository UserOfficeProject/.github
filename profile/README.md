The User Office Project is an international collaboration to build flexible web software to
effectively run and organise user programmes at a variety of science facilities.

We have built this software with flexibility in mind - allowing user officers and user
programme managers to configure the software to meet the needs of their facility.

### Features

- Scientists can submit proposals based on questionnaires and calls defined by user officers
- User officers can define workflows to describe different facility access routes
- Facility science staff can submit technical reviews on each proposal
- Science evaluation panels can be set up to review proposals 

### Where this is used

#### European Spallation Source

The [European Spallation Source] (ESS) started building this software in 2018 with the vision that it would
work for any facility. The ESS has been using the software to run their [Deuteration and Macromolecular
Crystallisation] (DEMAX) facility since 2020.

#### Science and Technology Facilities Council

The [Science and Technology Facilities Council] (STFC) joined the collaboration with the ESS in 2020.
The software has been used to accept proposals for facilities at STFC since late 2021 and has been
rolled out to the [ISIS Neutron and Muon Source], and the [Central Laser Facility].

### Demo

If you're interested in the software, contact ?

If you're a developer who wants to see what the software can do, you can follow the instructions in
the [`user-office-core` README](https://github.com/UserOfficeProject/user-office-core).
